# Machine Learning Projects
Here I will be posting my Machine Learning projects I have done during my Summer Trimester at NPU

## Falling Prediction using KNN

The project predicts if a person falls or not based on the readings of the Gyroscope sensor and Accelerometer sensor on their smartphone

The detailed project can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshineeRoopakula/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Falling%20Prediction%20using%20kNN).
